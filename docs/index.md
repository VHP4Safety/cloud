# VHP4Safety Cloud catalog

<!-- THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT. -->

VHP4Safety needs a cloud with a high diversity of services to support their case studies. The services will run on (interal) but also outside (external) the VHP4Safety cloud, on a case by case basis.

This webpage gives an overview of the VHP4Safety Cloud Services on the Production and Development platforms. The second is where we develop and test cloud services, while the first runs a stable version of the service.

Below you find an overview of services available in the context of the VHP4Safety Platform. [Additional services have been suggested](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/labels/service) and users can [request additional services](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/issues/new/choose).

## Cloud catalog

The VHP4Safety Cloud catalog of potential, internal, and external services is
available [here](catalog.md).

#### AOP-Wiki Snorql UI

A graphical interface to make queries to the AOP-Wiki SPARQL endpoint. [[more information](service/aopwiki.md)]

#### AOP-Wiki API

A REST API for AOP-Wiki content to make SPARQL queries. [[more information](service/aopwikiapi.md)]

#### ArrayAnalysis

A user-friendly service to conduct quality control and pre-processing analyses for microarray data. [[more information](service/arrayanalysis.md)]

#### BridgeDb

A framework to map identifiers between various biological databases and related sources. [[more information](service/bridgedb.md)]

A webservice to convert SMILES into 2D depictions in either SVG, PNG, and PNG formats. [[more information](service/cdkdepict.md)]

#### VHP4Safety Wikibase User Interface

A Synia-based graphical user interface to the content of the VHP4Safety Wikibase using SPARQL queries. [[more information](service/kb.md)]

#### MolAOP analyser

The MolAOP analyser service enables users to analyse transcriptomic data in the context of molecular Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs). The tool allows users to upload differential expression data or select from built-in demo datasets. It then guides them through gene selection, visualisation (volcano plots), and Key Event enrichment analysis based on predefined KE-to-pathway mappings. [[more information](service/molaopanalyser.md)]

#### OP PBK Model

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for organophosphates [[more information](service/oppbk_model.md)]

#### O'QT — OECD QSAR Toolbox AI Assistant

A multi-agent assistant that connects to a locally running OECD QSAR Toolbox Web API to analyze chemicals, profile hazards, and suggest read-across strategies. O’QT fetches properties, experimental data, and profiling outputs from the Toolbox and synthesizes them into an AI-generated report. [[more information](service/oqt_assistant.md)]

#### qAOP-App

An interactive tool offering an overview and dynamic time‐course predictions of KEs and AOs via ODE‐based qAOP models, based on VHP4Safety case studies. [[more information](service/qaop_app.md)]

#### QSPRpred

This tool allows users to predict the activity of their chemicals of interest for various endpoints. This prediction is done by target-specific, pretrained QSAR models. These models are specific for endpoints related to molecular initiation events from the VHP4Safety case studies. [[more information](service/qsprpred.md)]

#### SOM Prediction

A webservice to conduct protein-structure and reactivity based (P450) site-of-metabolism prediction. [[more information](service/sombie.md)]

#### ToxTempAssistant

A tool that uses Large Language Models to harmonize and complete method descriptions of in vitro toxicity tests based on the ToxTemp template. The tool alleviates the administrative burden on toxicologists by extracting methodological details from contextual documents, such as protocols, publications, or lab notebooks, and generating structured draft responses to the 77 questions of the ToxTemp template. [[more information](service/toxtemp_assistant.md)]

#### TXG-MAPr

An online application to implement weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) derived from the Primary Human Hepatocytes (PHH) TG-GATEs data sets. [[more information](service/txg_mapr.md)]

#### VHP4Safety Glossary

A collection of ontology with the names, abrreviations and definitions of the terminology that is used in the VHP4Safety project. [[more information](service/vhp_glossary.md)]

#### VHP4Safety Wikibase

A Wikibase instance to store and present information about toxic, safe and potentially toxic compounds related to the VHP4Safety project. [[more information](service/wikibase.md)]

#### WikiPathways - AOP Portal

An Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) portal for WikiPathways to highlight the molecular basis of AOPs or events in AOPs. [[more information](service/wikipathways_aop.md)]

#### xploreaop

A web application to visualize Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) networks and interactively explore the AOPs for two liver outcomes, Cholestasis and Steatosis. [[more information](service/xploreaop.md)]
