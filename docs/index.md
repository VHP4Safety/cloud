# VHP4Safety Cloud catalog

<!-- THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT. -->

VHP4Safety needs a cloud with a high diversity of services to support their case studies. The services will run on (interal) but also outside (external) the VHP4Safety cloud, on a case by case basis.

This webpage gives an overview of the VHP4Safety Cloud Services on the Production and Development platforms. The second is where we develop and test cloud services, while the first runs a stable version of the service.

Below you find an overview of services available in the context of the VHP4Safety Platform. [Additional services have been suggested](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/labels/service) and users can [request additional services](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/issues/new/choose).

## Cloud catalog

The VHP4Safety Cloud catalog of potential, internal, and external services is
available [here](catalog.md).


### Service Contributions

You are welcome to contribute to this catalog by requesting or adding new services. Please see [the manual](service/misc/creating_service_help_page.md) to see the options for contribute to the catalog. Please contact us through the issues using the [issue pages](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/issues) of this repository.

### VHP4Safety Platform

The current development platform runs several services.

#### AOP-Builder

A tool to explore scientific literature to extract relevant entities and their relations for AOP construction, using AI. [[more information](service/aop-builder.md)]

#### AOP-Wiki Snorql UI

A graphical interface to make queries to the AOP-Wiki SPARQL endpoint. [[more information](service/aopwiki.md)]

#### AOP-Wiki API

A REST API for AOP-Wiki content to make SPARQL queries. [[more information](service/aopwikiapi.md)]

#### BridgeDb

A framework to map identifiers between various biological databases and related sources. [[more information](service/bridgedb.md)]

#### CDK Depict

A webservice to convert SMILES into 2D depictions in either SVG, PNG, and PNG formats. [[more information](service/cdkdepict.md)]

#### VHP4Safety Wikibase User Interface

A Synia-based graphical user interface to the content of the VHP4Safety Wikibase using SPARQL queries. [[more information](service/vhp4safety_wikibase.md)]

#### OP PBK Model

To be added [[more information](service/oppbk_model.md)]

#### qAOP-App

An interactive tool offering an overview and dynamic time‐course predictions of KEs and AOs via ODE‐based qAOP models, based on VHP4Safety case studies. [[more information](service/qaop_app.md)]

#### QSPRpred

This tool allows users to predict the activity of their chemicals of interest for various endpoints. This prediction is done by target-specific, pretrained QSAR models. These models are specific for endpoints related to molecular initiation events from the VHP4Safety case studies. [[more information](service/qsprpred.md)]

#### SOM Prediction

A webservice to conduct protein-structure and reactivity based (P450) site-of-metabolism prediction. [[more information](service/sombie.md)]

#### TXG-MAPr

An online application to implement weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) derived from the Primary Human Hepatocytes (PHH) TG-GATEs data sets. [[more information](service/txg_mapr.md)]

#### VHP4Safety Wikibase

A Wikibase instance to store and present information about toxic, safe and potentially toxic compounds related to the VHP4Safety project. [[more information](service/wikibase.md)]

#### WikiPathways - AOP Portal

An Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) portal for WikiPathways to highlight the molecular basis of AOPs or events in AOPs. [[more information](service/wikipathways_aop.md)]

#### xploreaop

A web application to visualize Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) networks and interactively explore the AOPs for two liver outcomes, Cholestasis and Steatosis. [[more information](service/xploreaop.md)]

------------------------------------------

### External Services

#### CellDesigner

A structured diagram editor to draw gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. [[more information](service/celldesigner.md)]

#### CompTox

An online database to provide access to chemistry, toxicity, and exposure information for chemicals. [[more information](service/comptox.md)]

#### cpLogD

A model to predict water-octanol distribution coefficient (logD) for chemical compounds which is a proxy for the lipophilicity which is a major determinant of drug properties and overall suitability of drug candidates. [[more information](service/cplogd.md)]

#### Flame

An open source framework to develop, host, and use machine-learning models, such as QSAR-like models, in production environments. [[more information](service/flame.md)]

#### The OECD QSAR Toolbox

A software to support hazard assessment of chemicals as well as to increase mechanistic and other knowledge on chemical substances in a cost-efficient way. [[more information](service/oecd_qsar_toolbox.md)]

#### PopGen

An online service to generate a virtual human population. [[more information](service/popgen.md)]

#### SysRev

An online service to conduct literature review, data extraction and systematic review. [[more information](service/sysrev.md)]

### Funding

VHP4Safety – the Virtual Human Platform for safety assessment project
[NWA 1292.19.272](https://www.nwo.nl/projecten/nwa129219272) is part of the NWA
research program ‘Research along Routes by Consortia (ORC)’, which is funded by the Netherlands Organization
for Scientific Research (NWO). The project started on June 1, 2021 with a budget of over 10 million Euros
and will last for the duration of 5 years.
