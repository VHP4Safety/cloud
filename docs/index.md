# VHP4Safety Cloud catalog

<!-- THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT. -->

VHP4Safety needs a cloud with a high diversity of services to support their case studies. The services will run on (interal) but also outside (external) the VHP4Safety cloud, on a case by case basis.

This webpage gives an overview of the VHP4Safety Cloud Services on the Production and Development platforms. The second is where we develop and test cloud services, while the first runs a stable version of the service.

Below you find an overview of services available in the context of the VHP4Safety Platform. [Additional services have been suggested](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/labels/service) and users can [request additional services](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/issues/new/choose).
