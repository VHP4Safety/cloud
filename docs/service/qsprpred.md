<!--- This file is autogenerated. Edit qsprpred.json to make changes in this page. ---> 

This tool is intended for hazard assessment of novel chemicals. A user can give their chemical of interest and predict its activity on various endpoints. This prediction is done by target-specific QSAR models that have been created within the VHP4Safety consortium. Each of the models is specific for an endpoint related to a molecular initiation event from an adverse outcome pathway. This makes the models relevant for hazard assessment. To see how such models can be applied in a risk assessment context, go to the case studies on the platform (https://platform.vhp4safety.nl/casestudies).
